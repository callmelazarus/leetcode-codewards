--- PROMPT ---
Write a function that takes a string of braces, and determines if the order of the braces is valid. It should return true if the string is valid, and false if it's invalid.

This Kata is similar to the Valid Parentheses Kata, but introduces new characters: brackets [], and curly braces {}. Thanks to @arnedag for the idea!

All input strings will be nonempty, and will only consist of parentheses, brackets and curly braces: ()[]{}.

What is considered Valid?
A string of braces is considered valid if all braces are matched with the correct brace.

"(){}[]"   =>  True
"([{}])"   =>  True
"(}"       =>  False
"[(])"     =>  False
"[({})](]" =>  False

--- LESSONS ---
This is still such a hard problem for me...

Couldn't solve this. Searched for pseudocode answer online, and worked from there.
The correct logic itself was hard to establish

    core logic: what makes a valid parenthesis, a valid parenthesis?

from: https://www.educative.io/answers/the-valid-parentheses-problem

Declare an empty stack.
Push an opening parenthesis on top of the stack.
In case of a closing bracket, check if the stack is empty.
If not, pop in a closing parenthesis if the top of the stack contains the corresponding opening parenthesis.
If the parentheses are valid,â€‹ then the stack will be empty once the input string finishes.
