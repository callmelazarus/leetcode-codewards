**Today I worked on:**
- can place flowers e605
**Reflection:**
**Lesson:**


## Feb 18, 2023 - Sat

**Today I worked on:**
- can place flowers e605
**Reflection:**
- Today was working on last minute kindred site meeting with Alex, Prairie, and Jonathan
- Friday - payroll learning in morning and talk with Dinko. Then job hunting and Alex/Esther Park's wedding
- Thursday - so much Kindred stuff
**Lesson:**

## Feb 15, 2023 - Wed

**Today I worked on:**
- number of islands -m200 - definitely need to study
- so much to do for Kindred. HR duties, as well as presiding. Feeling overwhelmed..
**Reflection:**
**Lesson:**


## Feb 14, 2023 - Tues

**Today I worked on:**
- career fair in long beach... very sad turnout. 5 companies, really small room... no swe positions
- kindred website photo preparations
- Clippers vs. Warriors with dad :) no curry unfortunately, but still a fun time!
**Reflection:**
**Lesson:**

## Feb 13, 2023 - Monday

**Today I worked on:**
- running sum of 1d array - e1480
**Reflection:**
**Lesson:**



## Feb 10, 2023

**Today I worked on:**
- find center of star graph e1791
**Reflection:**
**Lesson:**


## Feb 9, 2023 - Thursday

**Today I worked on:**
- kindred website
researching how to turn google sheet into DB, using Sheets API.
Create a no-code sermon page, learning the differences between buttons, code, and embbeded
**Reflection:**
Squarespace definitely has limitations. Doesn't help that I am new to it. But it appears that to do more interesting things with it, you really need to work 'extra hard' within the strange boundaries of squarespace.
**Lesson:**
- google sheets can be used similarly to a DB, but requires authentication and an API key.
- doing 'unique' things in squarespace is it's own beast. A lot of custom CSS is necessary. would be interesting to use javascript


## Feb 7, 2023 - Tuesday

**Today I worked on:**
- Standup with Jon. Talked about valid stack sequences.
- Wrote my first article on medium! It was about earthquake readiness and prep, in light of the tragedy in Turkey/Syria

**Reflection:**

**Lesson:**


## Feb 6, 2023 - Monday

**Today I worked on:**
- valid stack sequences m946
**Reflection:**
- wow. It has been quite some time since I've LC'd... What happened? Last Thursday, had my first real interview! It was with Futek. Friday, I did more networking for applications, and had the hackathon for CCSC building the website for Kindred. This also bled into Saturday as well - along with spending time with Dennis afterwards.
- 
**Lesson:**


## Feb 1, 2023 - Wed

**Today I worked on:**
- mini max - Hacker Rank
**Reflection:**
**Lesson:**


## Jan 1/31 - Tuesday

**Today I worked on:**
- plus_minus - Hacker Rank
**Reflection:**
**Lesson:**
How to print something to the 6th decimal place using .format
https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format
    print('{0:.6f}'.format(zero/total))


## Jan 1/30 - Monday

**Today I worked on:**
- subsets m78
**Reflection:**
**Lesson:**


## Jan 1/26 - Thursday

**Today I worked on:**
- last stone weight -e1046
**Reflection:**
- cool that python has heaps built into it (minHeap) with heapq.
**Lesson:**
- use a maxHeap (takes O(N) time)
- Python doesn't have maxheap built in, so we will massage the minHeap by multiplying numbers by negative (super clever)
- Getting the max is a O(log N) operation

## Jan 1/25 - Wed

**Today I worked on:**

- binary tree right side view -m199

**Reflection:**

**Lesson:**

## Jan 1/23 - Monday

**Today I worked on:**

- evaluate reverse polish notation -m150
  **Reflection:**
  **Lesson:**

## Jan 21, 2023 - Sat

**Today I worked on:**

- Copy List with Random Pointer -m138

**Reflection:**

- interesting how you can create a hashmap with NODE data structures...and not just other primative data structures

**Lesson:**

## Jan 20, 2023 - Friday

**Today I worked on:**

- longest palindromic substring -m5

**Reflection:**

- today was a productive day for the most part. It invovled desirable difficulty, learning new things, and achieving some goals I set for myself

**Lesson:**

## Jan 19, 2023 - Thursday

**Today I worked on:**

- Linked list udemy course
- add two numbers -m2

**Reflection:**

- the dummy node makes a lot more sense this go around, when compared to when I just started in November.

**Lesson:**

- list.reverse() reverses the original list
- it helps to write out an example problem as you think when you are looping thru things
- `while 1:` will be true, and run. The '1' can be any non-zero
- `while 0:` will not loop.
- good to setup dummy nodes for LL problems

## Jan 18, 2023 - Wednesday

**Today I worked on:**

- binary tree right side - m199

**Reflection:**
**Lesson:**

## Jan 16, 2023 - Monday

**Today I worked on:**

- Attempted binary tree right side m199
- Reviewed koko eating bananas

**Reflection:**

- today was MLK day. Spent time with my folks. Watched knives out, both of them enjoyed it. It was the first sunny day in a little while. Tried to be more creative in how I applied to jobs by searching for construction jobs, and also searching for companies on LinkedIn, and then jobs (versus just searching the job boards)
- The prompt is garbage for the binary tree right side... just garbage...

**Lesson:**

## Jan 14, 2023 - Sat

**Today I worked on:**

- watched an intro video on NumPy.
- valid sudoku -m36

  **Reflection:**

- I was proud of actually figuring out most of valid sudoku on my own, but couldn't automate the subbox routine. Turns out there was this crazy integer operation // that you could use to associate the subboxes with indexes. NC's solution also uses collection defaultdict(sets), which is amazing. the value of the dictionary is a hashset...

**Lesson:**

- NumPy is a python library that you would use to work with large arrays.
- collections default dict is VERY similar to a dict, BUT will never raise a keyerror if a value doesn't exist
- default dict is a subdivision of the dict class

- the defaultdict can have values as hashset's which is so cool. The value is now a hashset, which you can add to

## Jan 13, 2023 - Friday

**Today I worked on:**

- pascals triangle -e118
- remove element -e27

**Reflection:**

- it felt great solving pascals triangle on my own. very rewarding. It wasn't the most straightforward problem, but I was able to solve it within 30 minutes.

**Lesson:**

- take your time, test your solutions.

---

## Jan 12, 2023 - Thursday

**Today I worked on:**

- squares in a sorted array -e977
- (started) pascals triangle -e118

**Reflection:**

**Lesson:**

## Jan 11, 2023 - Wednesday

**Today I worked on:**

- search a 2D matrix - m74
- koko eating bananas - m875

**Reflection:**
koko eating bananas is a great binary search problem, if you want to see more logic, embedded in the binary search itself

**Lesson:**
LC - python3 seems to have more functionality than python (no surprise). But I am getting failures in python using the same code, but success when running python3

- m74
- You can create pointers for a matrix, using the len of the matrix, and the len of a particular entry in that matrix

- Interesting looping breaking scheme. We have else: break. To check if that did not fire, we do a conditional of the loop conditional using
  ' if not (top <= bot) ' -> which will be 'if not False' -> 'if True'
  Because top <= bot is no longer true -> which is why we broke out of the while loop

          # if we never broke out of loop, and we have never been able to find the target value
          # if we didn't break out of loop in the else statment, then top <= bot if FALSE
          # therefore, note that for it to return true, you write
          # if not (top <= bot) -> which will return TRUE if we didn't 'break out' using else

          if not (top <= bot): -> this will be ' if not False'
              print(top <= bot)
              return False

- koko eating bananas m875
- if you have a sorted array that you are searching - THINK BINARY SEARCH
- on the surface, this doesn't seem like a binary search problem... it is interesting to think of how when you try to optimize for a solution by establishing a list of potential answers (k_list) which is sorted, binary search comes into play

## Jan 10, 2023 - Tuesday

**Today I worked on:**

- Connected with Jon, Brendan, Chris, and Kindred external committee
- arranging coins - e441

**Reflection:**

- there is a huge mathmatical relationship needed to complete arranging coins that is not reasonable to know given in an interview

**Lesson:**

## Jan 9, 2023 - Monday

**Today I worked on:**

- setting up my photography portfolio - @gophotosocal

**Reflection:**

- definitely quite fatigued today...did not feel so great

**Lesson:**

## Jan 6, 2023 - Friday

**Today I worked on:**

- I am reconsidering restructuring my schedule/process for finding a job. It has been 53 days since graduation at this point. The udemy course is in some sense taking the place of LC.

**Reflection:**

**Lesson:**

- strings are IMMUTABLE - so you need to use methods like slice, substring to make copies of strings
- Copy objects using object.assign OR spread operator ...

## Jan 5, 2023 - Thursday

**Today I worked on:**

- udemy JS DSA: problem solving patterns.
  - frequency counters
  - multiple pointers
  - sliding windows
  - divide and conquer intro

**Reflection:**

- worked on udemy course at Andrew's place. It was a good refresher, especially in doing some of the problems in JS

**Lesson:**
0 is falsy in JS

- binary search - the left pointer should be mid + 1, and right pointer is just mid. This is because we ultimately don't want to include the midpoint, since midpoint is related to the solution condition.

## Jan 4, 2023 - Wed

**Today I worked on:**

- Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array - m153
- Search insert position - e35

**Reflection:**

- solved the problem that I had yesterday by RETURNING the recursive call, not simply running the recursive call
- I feel like I often need to add an easy LC problem here and there to boost my moral
- today definitely feeling a lot more discouragement in this whole job hunt.

**Lesson:**

- return the recursive call if you want to return that data

## Jan 3, 2022 - Tues

**Today I worked on:**

- Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array - m153 - didnt finish

**Reflection:**

- harder to get back into things after the holidays
- having such a terrible time with m153. My solution is working, but my recursive call keeps mysteriously returning none. However, when I do print statements, the base case is working correctly.... I am returning the call to the helper function as well. This is so frustrating... it looks like I have the answer, but it just isn't working....

**Lesson:**

## Jan 2, 2022 - Monday

**Today I worked on:**

- word pattern - e290

**Reflection:**

**Lesson:**

- using zip in your loop allows you to loop thru two iterables at the same time

## Dec 31, 2022 - Sat

**Today I worked on:**

- Generate Parenthesis - m22
- Daily Temperatures -m739 (NTR)
- baseball game - e682

**Reflection:**

- it is still very hard to translate these thoughts into code...
- I still don't feel like i can solve these problems on my own..
- baseball game is too easy

**Lesson:**

- enumerate helps you loop, giving you the index, and the iterand in that order
- the data structure you setup matters (e290). pattern

## Dec 29, 2022 - Thursday

**Today I worked on:**

- coin change 2 - m518
- minstack - m155

**Reflection:**

- getting back into oop with minstack, good practice, but it is telling that again, I am having some issues with working with objects.

**Lesson:**

- Read the problem carefully - the pop method will 'remove' the last element (and return it) but the top method is there to just retrieve the last element

## Dec 28, 2022 - Wednesday

**Today I worked on:**

- climbing stairs - e70
- Coin Change - m322

**Reflection:**

- e70 I solved on my own, but I did recall the little hint from Jon's walkthru, that the solution was essentially a running sum. I am not sure if I could have seen that running sum appear as the solution on my own

**Lesson:**

- Place data structures that you will manipulate outside of any loops (or else you will reset
  that data structure)

- It helped to write out the various solutions to see patterns, as well as also typing out
  what I anticipate the code to spit out.
- If decisions are being made, try to solve the problem using a decision tree. When you think of 'tree', you can think of DFS, BFS.

## Dec 27 - Tuesday

**Today I worked on:**

- house robber - m198 (NTR)

**Reflection:**

- m198 is a dp problem that is not of the sort that I recall from HR days.
- m198 def needs a revisit. It is kind of making sense, but is still a bit magical

**Lesson:**

## Dec 26, Monday - day after Christmas

**Today I worked on:**

- Reorder list m143 (NTR)
- Remove Nth Node From End of List - m19

**Reflection:**

- LL is it's own beast
- It was GREAT to figure out m19 on its own, but it was definitely a grind... It helped to take some breaks and come back to it. I couldn't help but think - how would I approach this on an interview, as the temptation to just walk away from the problem was strong... I need more mental grit.
- m19 reminded me why we need to have a solution_pointer to the head of the SLL, as well as another pointer. The regular pointer allows you to manipulate the SLL, and the solution_pointer will be used to return as the solution. It was great to do this on my own, without the guidance of a soultion.
- today was a specifically harder day to be productive. Dealing with headaches and fatigue...

**Lesson:**

- it helps to write out the problem on the screen, with notes, and print statements that define variables to confirm that I'm doing what I anticipate things correctly.

## Dec 23, 2022 - Fri

**Today I worked on:**

- construct binary tree from preorder and inorder traversal - m105
- length of last word - e58

**Reflection:**

- I have very little interest in LC today, just overall quite tired...
- m105 actually made a bit of sense to me, but I just needed a bit of nudging on how to form the actual recursive call. I do think I could have figured out the base case if I gave myself a little more time to wrestle with uncertainty.
- Submitted my first solution (e58) into discussion on LC.

**Lesson:**
Traversing a binary Tre
Inorder => Left, Root, Right.
Preorder => Root, Left, Right.
Post order => Left, Right, Root.
split function is O(n) time complexity

## Dec 22, 2022 - Thur

**Today I worked on:**

- Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree m235

organizing up files in repo

**Reflection:**

- Recognized today, that I really do like making things, and I'm so grateful to make this switch to coding. This change is opening my eyes to being an inventor, a tinkerer, and coding will allow me to do this.

**Lesson:**
understanding the solution sets of a problem, will help you understand a solution

## Dec 21, 2022 - Wednesday

**Today I worked on:**

- validate binary search tree m98
- kth smallest element in a Binary search tree m230
- move zeroes e283

**Reflection:**

- I am getting a better feel for when I realize a problem is way over my head
- It was nice to get a decent recursive solution setup for m98. Hopefully with each day, these things will get incrementally better.
- some problems, you have to think of another way the question is asking a particular problem (like move zeroes). think of alternative ways to solve a problem.

**Lesson:**

- reminder - argument -> function call. parameter -> function definition
- one way to represent +/- infinity in python: float("inf") and float("-inf")
- need to use stack with iterative approach for DFS for tree problems, which means you will be appending and popping,
  and also likely using the fact that the stack is null or non-null as part of that while loop.
- In this problem, the while condition is if the stack is non-null OR if the current node is non-null

## Dec 20, 2022 - Tuesday

**Today I worked on:**
(preview) missing Number e268

- convert sorted array to binary search tree e108 (NTR)
- valid palindrome 2 e680
- replace elements with greatest element on right e1299
- Is Subsequence e392

**Reflection:**
I actually came up with what I think is a great solution for valid palindrome 2, but couldn't get one of the very last test cases to run. Not going to sweat it, proud of the fact that I solved this one on my own with no help.
I tried to do two easier ones, and thankfully was able to get them solved on my own!

**Lesson:**
insert function in python allows you to add to a list in the beginning

## Dec 19, 2022 - Monday

**Today I worked on:**

- (review) balancedbinary tree (NTR)
- diameter of binary tree e543 (NTR)
- merge two binary trees e617 (NTR)
- path sum e112 (NTR)

**Reflection:**
Feeling less motivated with the LC. It was a busier weekend, good but busy.
merge two binary trees is a great recursive example

**Lesson:**
if you want the recursive function to be returning something like a height, make sure you are 'writing' that in the return statement! duh...

## Dec 16, 2022 - Fri

**Today I worked on:**

- preview: counting bits
- balanced binary tree e110 (NTR)

**Reflection:**

**Lesson:**

## Dec 15, 2022 - Thur

**Today I worked on:**

- preview: number of 1 bits
- more react native practice
- pramp - lowest cost (recursion, trees, classes)
- Binary tree level order traversal m102

**Reflection:**

- it was cool to see a BFS solution, using queues. It is still a little magical to me, but in time, it will make sense

**Lesson:**

- breadth first search will use queues
- you can initialize queues in python using collections.deque()
- The largest possible/worst case level of a tree is n/2, where n is the # of nodes in a binary tree

## Dec 14, 2022 - Wed

**Today I worked on:**

- focused on React Native today to finish class before expiration.

**Reflection:**

**Lesson:**

- I need to read documentation, and follow it, in order. I spent nearly 2 hours on config for React Native, and my problem, was that I didn't have the right dependencies installed to run the android emulator.

## Dec 13, 2022 - Tues

**Today I worked on:**

1. Group anagram m49
2. isomorphic string (cont and finished)
   REVISIT: Valid parenthesis. This problem gave me so much trouble in the past, and it did again, but I was able to solve it much quicker.

**Reflection:**

**Lesson:**
you can loop thru strings of the same length using the zip()

## Dec 12, 2022 - Mon

**Today I worked on:**

1. Product of array except self
2. Longest consecutive sequence
3. isomorphic string

**Reflection:**
Thinking about how we solve these problems. We break down the properties of the problems we are trying to solve.
If we are trying to find max sequence - what are the properties of a sequnce? Are any of those properties helpful for us to solve this problem

**Lesson:**
There is this pattern where you manipulate things, right at the end of a for loop, which allows you to use that manipulated value in the next for loop.
Searching thru a set is O(1) time complexity, very fast. Set's don't have any repeat values, and are unordered.
a reminder that you can run for loops, indexes, and lengths on strings

## Dec 10, 2022 - Sat

**Today I worked on:**

1. Top K frequent elements

**Reflection:**
Started using Akideck to build out flashcards that may present useful information that I learn.

**Lesson:**
Super cool way of counting elements:

```
    count = {}
    # build the counter dict
    for n in nums:
        # this is how we count how many times something occurs
        count[n] = 1 + count.get(n, 0)
```

## Dec 9, 2022 - Fri

**Today I worked on:**

1. binary search - JS
2. search a 2d matrix

**Reflection:**
Don't forget about while loops!

**Lesson:**

## Dec 8, 2022 - Thur

**Today I worked on:**

1. combination sum - cont.
2. Max length of a concat string with unique characters! Solved without help!!!

Tried to restore gitlab remote connection

**Reflection:**
Continuing to grok combination sum
It seems like I am able to push to both gitLab and github now. I will just add/commit a message. And do a `git push`. and then a `git push gitlab main` to push to both repo's.

**Lesson:**
I can figure these things out, but some of these things take time... and also noticing the little 'trick' that will get me there

## Dec 7, 2022 - Wed

**Today I worked on:**

1. combination sum

**Reflection:**
DFS, backtracking, recursive problems still hard...
didnt have the gusto in me today to do 2 problems...

**Lesson:**

## Dec 6, 2022 - Tues

**Today I worked on:**

- 3 LC style problems for Telsa codility challenge
- Maximum Length of a Concatenated String with Unique Characters

**Reflection:**

- for tech questions, just need to take your time as you go thru the problem

**Lesson:**
Code challenges

1. write notes as you read thru question
2. write on a piece of paper if needed
3. Challenge assumptions with reviewer
4. write pseudocode
5. start writing code
6. test code regularly

## Dec 5, 2022 - Mon

**Today I worked on:**

- longest substring without repeating character
- running sum of 1d array
- find pivot index

**Reflection:**

- sliding windows problems are just 2 pointers, but considering a subarray of a problem

**Lesson:**

- sum fxn in python is O(n) time

## Dec 3, 2022 - Sat

**Today I worked on:**

- 4Sum / array quadruplet
- conatiner with most water
- pramp technical interview -> contains duplicates

**Reflection:**

- 4Sum is no joke... don't know how I would solve this on my own....
- reviewing it with kyle was fun
- solving my problem - contains duplicates was fun as well.

**Lesson:**

- constant space complexity is when you have a condition where you have a set size that you are saving something
- take your time to think thru things, you will be nervous as you think thru problems
- think of conditionals that will determine WHEN you move the pointer

## Dec 2, 2022 - Fri

**Today I worked on:**

- REVISIT: 2 sum
- 2 Sum 2
- 3 sum

**Reflection:**

- these little tricks to these problems that I doubt I would figure out on the spot in an interview... 2 sum 2 and 3 sum are no joke....

**Lesson:**

- using 2 pointers for these problems is helpful
- sort method in python is O(nlogn) time complexity
- sort() mutates the list, and is implemented as list.sort()

## DEC 1, 2022 - Thur

**Today I worked on:**

1. Subtree of another Tree (extension to same_tree)
2. invert binary tree (another time from memory!!)
3. backspace string compare (easy - first one in a while I solved on my own, in less than 10 min!)

**Reflection:**

- this was the first LC problem that was actually enjoyable, even tho I didn't quite get the solution. I think the general logic was in my head, but writing the code out, especially the recursive nature of the code is uncertain to me
- I was on the right path in thinking about using a helper function
- the recursion is still challenging to me
- got practice with list comprehension, try/except, and helper functions today

**Lesson:**

- recursion solutions - simply define your edge cases/ return statements as the base case
- you likely will be returning something in the recursive call

## Nov 30, 2022 - Wednesday

**Today I worked on:**
transfer repo from gitlab to github.

1. same tree e100
2. invert binary tree in JS

**Reflection:**

- the reqmt for recursion is starting to get easier to spot. Writing it seems to still start with the base case, and then moving forward.

**Lesson:**

- in an `if` conditional, nothing something as `if not value` is the way to test if a node is is None/empty. If it is empty, than that statement will return `True`
- setting a new remote - github. use command `git remote add origin REPO_URL`. I think that is the process
- Trying to figure out my process here. May need to do this again with another repo that I am trying to trasnfer to GH. History:
  1. commit - 'transfer to github'
  2. git remote add origin
  3. commit 'test push to github'
  4. git remote set-rul 'url'
  5. commit - 'test push to github'
  6. git push --set-upstream origin main
  7. commit - 'fixed filename for invert binary tree JS'

## Nov 29, 2022 - Tuesday

**Today I worked on:**

1. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree

**Reflection:**

- Would not have figured out on my own, the need to keep track of the counter of the depth of the tree using the +1

**Lesson:**

## Nov 28, 2022 - Monday

**Today I worked on:**

1. merge two sorted list in JS

**Reflection:**

- I was focusing on doing work that makes and impact. Even if I'm going slowly, I am doing better than my old self. For this reason, I am happy with the 1.5 hours I spent on merge two sorted list. It did help though, that I had seen this problem before... but even still, I consider this a win.

**Lesson:**

- dummy nodes are typically created in SLL in order to allow you to keep track of the head of your solution SLL

## Nov 26, 2022 - Saturday

**Today I worked on:**
linked list cycle

**Reflection:**

- This was actually a bit more fun. Did this at the end of the day.
  To solve this problem, we used 2 pointers again, that advance at different rates. Genius.
- It isn't the amount of time I spend, it is the impact I make in the time I have

**Lesson:**
is not vs !=
`==` is an equality check
`is` is a idendity check, to see if the objects are exactly the same.
You would use the `is` check with `None`.
In Markdown, if you want to keep your bullets and index in check, make sure you create a new line after a bulleted object

## Nov 25, 2022 - Friday

**Today I worked on:**

- reverse linked list

**Reflection:**

- these LC problems are hard. They aren't meant to be easy

**Lesson:**

## Nov 22, 2022 - Tuesday

**Today I worked on:**
longest common prefix
**Reflection:**
Today, worked with Andrew this morning which was cool. got to see some nodejs. Unfortuantely, he told me later that his wife tested postive for covid.... he was ok, and I spent all my time with him, but I am just hoping I am ok...
Dealing with just strange edge cases in longest common prefix. annoying..
**Lesson:**

## Nov 21, 2022 - Monday

**Today I worked on:**
best time to buy and sell stock

**Reflection:**
Leetcode is still very challenging, but understanding the solution is definitely more tolerable than coming up with the solution (captain obvious)

**Lesson:**
Sliding window can be dynamic, it saves on time complexity (O(n) vs O(n^2)).
Sliding window, using the two pointers will help me compare two values within a list, to calc a max difference

## Nov 19, 2022 - Saturday

**Today I worked on:**

- valid palindrome (two pointers type)
- ransom note (Hashmap done for fun, from grind 75)
  **Reflection:**
- If I slow down to think about these problems, I can figure it out
  **Lesson:**
- making helper functions can be helpful!
- ord() method in python will return the unicode value associated with a character

## Nov 18 - Friday

**Today I worked on:**

- Contains duplicate (< 5 min - hashmap type)
- re-did - valid anagram (10 min - hashmap type)
- Two Sum (hashmap type)
- group anagrams (my first med!! Hashmap type)

**Reflection:**

- looked into neetcode vs educative's grokking

**Lesson:**

- sort fxn in python is time complexity O(nlogn)
- set function in python has a O(1) time complexity, worst case O(n), with space complexity of O(n)
- len is O(c) time complexity

## Nov 17 - Thursday

**Today I worked on:**

- more flood fill
  **Reflection:**

**Lesson:**

- work smarter not harder. Consider using courses, instead of just plowing thru leetcode
- difference between a tag and button tag
- litle steps forward are still steps
- use 'n' to interatively manage nodejs versions
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7718313/how-to-change-to-an-older-version-of-node-js

## Nov 16, 2022 - Wednesday

**Today I worked on:**

- Binary search [iterative approach]
- Flood Fill again

**Reflection:**

- getting back into leetcode. This past Monday was graduation, and last week was career services.
- floodfill is not easy to process
  **Lesson:**
- at 3pm, when I have low energy, I can do a walk and talk, prepare for behavorial interviews

## Nov 7, 2022 - Monday

**Today I worked on:**
continuation of Binary Search

**Reflection:**
Will return to Binary Search
Bootcamp consisted of career services. Working in Huntr and LinkedIn. Will aim to complete one Leetcode today, and for the rest of M-Thursday this week.

**Lesson:**

## Nov 5, 2022 - Saturday

**Today I worked on:**

1. valid palindrome - not hard.. but figuring out the string manipulation with regex took time (finished)
2. invert binary tree - (very challenging, could not do alone)
3. valid anagram - actually easy... (actually completed in 15 min, first try. wohoo!)
4. Binary Search - did not finish

**Reflection:**

- it is an interesting feeling of trying to meet my goal of finishing a certain number of leetcode problems, but my ignorance of certain libraries are slowing me down. The fact that the journey is the reward is hard to hold onto - as I know there is value in learning the RE library, but I need to only learn just enough to accomplish the problem.
- Some of the business logic is actually easy to figure out, but learning a new python library can be challenging. I watched YT videos while working out on REgex, and then had to do more digging.
- Grind 75 notes that this probably should only take 15 minutes. If I knew how to use Regex, I would probably finish the problem in 15 minutes.
- LC2: recursion is still challenging to wrap my head around
- I had a general idea of what to do for binary tree, didn't recognize that recursion was the way to go. Went thru the process again of getting a solution online, and running with it in hopes to understand the solution after processing it.

**Lesson:**

- RE-gex library has multiple string maniupulation methods. I used the findall method, which found a certain substring of strings, and returned a list of individual letters in the correct order (removed punctuation, and the spaces.
- You can actually check to see if one dictionary is equal to another dictionary
- You can check to see if something is in a dictionary using 'in'

## Nov 4, 2022 - Friday

**Today I worked on:**

1. merge two sorted list - needed help. hard
2. best time to buy sell stock - needed help. hard
3. valid palindrome - relatively easy (did not complete, struggling with character fixing)

**Reflection:**

- Linked lists are made up of nodes, that point to other nodes. Each node has both a value, and a pointer to the subsequent node.
- Spent over an hour simply trying to figure out the solution. Needed to go into a solution, and went thru the solution line by line.
- nearly took the entire day to really dig thru this one problem.
- Need to reform the way I prepare, establish more structure.

- Stock question: knowing algo's will help you solve these (this is similar to bubble sort). But the problem, is that it is too slow.... need to use dynamic programming to make this faster

- What I hope to learn: being able to be more calm and collected as I solve a problem.
- LC3 - removing the unicode characters is hard....

**Lesson:**

- LC: need to figure out the core logic of the problem, and what code you need to write to solve that core logic
  Trying to learn the **name** == "**main**" statement:
  https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-does-the-if-__name__-__main__-do/

- IF python interpreter is running the source file as 'main' program, it sets the **name** variable to have a value **main**.

- Encoding: assigning numbers to characters
- ASCII(american standard code for information interchange): character encoding standard for communication.
- Unicode: standard for enconding, representing, and handling texts.

## Nov 3, 2022 - Thursday

**Today I worked on:**

1. valid parenthesis - easy

**Reflection:**
Finally solved this!!! Needed the help of the online pseudocode though...
I do see value in this approach, as the solution helps close the gaps in my mind. I will make a video to accompany the solution, explaining the thought process as well.
**Lesson:**
