## Nov 5, 2022 - Saturday

**Today I worked on:**

1. valid palindrome - not hard.. but figuring out the string manipulation with regex took time (finished)
2. invert binary tree - (very challenging, could not do alone)
3. valid anagram - actually easy... (actually completed in 15 min, first try. wohoo!)
4. Binary Search

**Reflection:**

- it is an interesting feeling of trying to meet my goal of finishing a certain number of leetcode problems, but my ignorance of certain libraries are slowing me down. The fact that the journey is the reward is hard to hold onto - as I know there is value in learning the RE library, but I need to only learn just enough to accomplish the problem.
- Some of the business logic is actually easy to figure out, but learning a new python library can be challenging. I watched YT videos while working out on REgex, and then had to do more digging.
- Grind 75 notes that this probably should only take 15 minutes. If I knew how to use Regex, I would probably finish the problem in 15 minutes.
- LC2: recursion is still challenging to wrap my head around
- I had a general idea of what to do for binary tree, didn't recognize that recursion was the way to go. Went thru the process again of getting a solution online, and running with it in hopes to understand the solution after processing it.

**Lesson:**

- RE-gex library has multiple string maniupulation methods. I used the findall method, which found a certain substring of strings, and returned a list of individual letters in the correct order (removed punctuation, and the spaces.
- You can actually check to see if one dictionary is equal to another dictionary
- You can check to see if something is in a dictionary using 'in'

## Nov 4, 2022 - Friday

**Today I worked on:**

1. merge two sorted list - needed help. hard
2. best time to buy sell stock - needed help. hard
3. valid palindrome - relatively easy (did not complete, struggling with character fixing)

**Reflection:**

- Linked lists are made up of nodes, that point to other nodes. Each node has both a value, and a pointer to the subsequent node.
- Spent over an hour simply trying to figure out the solution. Needed to go into a solution, and went thru the solution line by line.
- nearly took the entire day to really dig thru this one problem.
- Need to reform the way I prepare, establish more structure.

- Stock question: knowing algo's will help you solve these (this is similar to bubble sort). But the problem, is that it is too slow.... need to use dynamic programming to make this faster

- What I hope to learn: being able to be more calm and collected as I solve a problem.
- LC3 - removing the unicode characters is hard....

**Lesson:**

- LC: need to figure out the core logic of the problem, and what code you need to write to solve that core logic
  Trying to learn the **name** == "**main**" statement:
  https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-does-the-if-__name__-__main__-do/

- IF python interpreter is running the source file as 'main' program, it sets the **name** variable to have a value **main**.

- Encoding: assigning numbers to characters
- ASCII(american standard code for information interchange): character encoding standard for communication.
- Unicode: standard for enconding, representing, and handling texts.

## Nov 3, 2022 - Thursday

**Today I worked on:**

1. valid parenthesis - easy
   **Reflection:**
   Finally solved this!!! Needed the help of the online pseudocode though...
   I do see value in this approach, as the solution helps close the gaps in my mind. I will make a video to accompany the solution, explaining the thought process as well.
