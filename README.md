**Today I worked on:**

1. merge two sorted list_easy

By going thru the challenge...no matter how far I get. 
   **Reflection:**
   Linked lists are made up of nodes, that point to other nodes. Each node has both a value, and a pointer to the subsequent node.
   Spent over an hour simply trying to figure out the solution. Needed to go into a solution, and went thru the solution line by line. 
  nearly took the entire day to really dig thru this one problem. 
  Need to reform the way I prepare, establish more structure.

   **Lesson:**
   Trying to learn the **name** == "**main**" statement:

**Today I worked on:**

1. valid parenthesis - easy
